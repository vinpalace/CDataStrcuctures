Adjacency Matrix

make index from vertex list. and it is unweigted.

*for undirected graph adjancency matrix is symmetric.

for finding adjanceny nodes we need to first grab the index from the vertex list and then scan that particular row in the matrix.
Whereever we find 1 we keep those values and get back the vertices from the indexlist.

time complexity is good but memory ussage is very high.
